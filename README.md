# Sortie: Total War

`Sortie: Total War` is a strategic war game, with players using a deck of upgradeable cards consisting of troops, leaders, and battle tactics. With game assets stored on the Ethereum blockchain, players are free to trade and monetize their decks and build growing communities as the game develops.

Utilizing the ITEM standard, each minted deck contains a unique playable map which changes with each two-player match up, creating new challenges and opportunities to harden your troops, claim territories, and unlock new talents for your army.
